# IDS
In the field of cybersecurity, ML algorithms play a crucial role in detecting and mitigating attacks on systems and networks. These algorithms can be classified into various categories based on their functionalities and underlying principles. To ensure optimal performance, it is important to carefully select the appropriate parameters and datasets for training these algorithms. Preprocessing and training the datasets properly is also crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable results. As such, we suggest utilizing the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which has been minimally worked on with various algorithms, and applying the Select-K-Best feature selection method to eliminate a significant number of its features. By comparing the performance of various algorithms on this modified dataset, it is possible to identify the most effective approach for detecting attacks and maintaining a satisfactory success rate.
